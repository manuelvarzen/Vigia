A day of tweets in the Congress of the Republic of Peru: discourse and actions? 

The tweet seems to be the quickest way to communicate any other issue if it is in the case of the public question the same one that has been entrusted to politicians by citizens.{: style="text-align: justify"}

But is it possible to manage the political discourse from the sphere of tweets, re-tweets, hashtag, media, url and others? Do they reach 240 characters to sustain and derive a public debate regarding a specific issue, local, national, international or global?{: style="text-align: justify"}

Do we witness an exacerbation of that second orality that Walter Ong explained in his book the "technology of the written word"? Or is it that we should keep present today more than ever the premise of McLuhan, "the medium is language"?{: style="text-align: justify"}

Note: In the image, the green points are the congressmen and the red ones, the users. Among them the relationships are established through tweets, re-tweets, hashtag, among others. {: style="text-align: justify"}
